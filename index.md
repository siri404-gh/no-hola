# How to watch IPL in Germany

The best and seamless way to watch IPL in Germany is to use YuppTV. I think the monthly subscription costs about 20â‚¬.


But, if you dont want to do that, or if you are wary of illegal streaming sites, and if you like to take advantange of obvious loopholes by VPNs, this works fine for me. I have tested this and works for me just fine.

## Steps

1. Pay for Hotstar Premium. It costs me Rs.299 every IPL season.
2. Install Hola VPN browser extension.
3. Create a bookmark with this as url:
```js
javascript:(function()%7Bdocument.getElementById('_hola_popup_iframe__').remove()%3Bdocument.querySelector('body%20%3E%20div%3Anth-child(9)').hidden%20%3D%20true%7D)()
```
4. Just click on this bookmark everytime you see the hola timer popup.

**Note**: There are known vulnerabilities of using Hola VPN free service. But I havent had any issues so far. Use it at your own risk.
