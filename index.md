If you are wary of illegal streaming sites, if you like to take advantange of obvious loopholes by VPNs, this works fine for me.


1. Pay for Hotstar Premium. It costs me Rs299 every IPL season.
2. Install Hola VPN browser extension.
3. Create a bookmark with this as url:
```js
javascript:(function()%7Bdocument.getElementById('_hola_popup_iframe__').remove()%3Bdocument.querySelector('body%20%3E%20div%3Anth-child(9)').hidden%20%3D%20true%7D)()
```
4. Just click on this bookmark when you see the hola timer popup.

**Note**: There are known vulnerabilities of using Hola VPN free service. But I havent had any issues so far. Use it at your own risk.
