If you are wary of streaming sites, if you like to take advantange of obvious loopholes by vpns, this works fine for me.

1. Pay for Hotstar Premium.
2. Install hola vpn extension
3. Create a bookmark with this as url:
"javascript:(function()%7Bdocument.getElementById('_hola_popup_iframe__').remove()%3Bdocument.querySelector('body%20%3E%20div%3Anth-child(9)').hidden%20%3D%20true%7D)()"
4. Just click on this bookmark when you see the hola timer popup.
